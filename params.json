Upon reception, the mobile node estimates the RSSs of the beacons, converts it into distance measures and triangulates its position by using the best three beacons.\r\n### Requirements:\r\n1. Create a specific component to simulate RSS estimation. The component acts as an oracle, knowing the trajectory of the mobile node and the position of all the anchors. Use a log-distance path loss model for power-to-distance conversion, e.g. P = P0 + 10log10(d/d0) + v, with v an additive Gaussian noise of known distance.\r\n2. From the estimated RSSI, retrieve a distance measure (only for the best 3 anchor nodes).\r\n3. Use the Gradient Descent triangulation techniques to obtain the position of the mobile node.\r\n4. Compute and plot the localization error VS the Gaussian noise variance v.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nThe plot with the localization error on Y and the Gaussian noise variance on X is:\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://www.stefanocappa.it/publicfiles/Github_repositories_images/IotLocalization/1-results.png)\r\n<br>\r\n![alt tag](http://www.stefanocappa.it/publicfiles/Github_repositories_images/IotLocalization/3-cooja-results.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Video\r\n\r\n\r\n## News\r\n- *04/05/2015* - **IOT Localization** 1.0.0 released\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n- 2 projects in one repository.
